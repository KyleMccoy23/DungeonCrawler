# Dungeon Crawler - WIP

## Overview
Dungeon Crawler is a roguelike game that simulates a D&D adventure in a text-based interface. The player creates a character by choosing a race, class, and name, and kill everything in the dungeon full of traps, treasures, and enemies. The player can use commands like `look`, `move`, `attack`, `cast`, `use`, and `inventory` to interact with the environment and combat. The goal is to defeat all enough enemys to fight the final boss, or die trying.

## Features
- 10 different races, each with their own abilities and traits: Human, Elf, Dwarf, Halfling, Gnome, Half-Elf, Half-Orc, Tiefling, Dragonborn, and Aasimar.
- 12 different classes, each with their own skills and spells: Fighter, Rogue, Wizard, Cleric, Ranger, Bard, Paladin, Barbarian, Monk, Sorcerer, Warlock, and Druid.
- A turn-based combat system that uses D&D rules determine the outcome of actions.
- A variety of enemies, from goblins and skeletons to dragons and demons, each with their own stats and behaviors.
- A loot system that randomly generates weapons, armor, potions, scrolls, and other items, some of which are magical or cursed.
- A permadeath mechanic that deletes the character and the dungeon if the player dies, making each run unique and challenging.
